  Zone of Truth
  2nd-level Enchantment

  Casting Time: 1 action
  Range: 60 feet
  Components: Verbal, Somatic
  Duration: 10 minutes

  You create a magical zone that guards against deceoption in a
  15-foot radius sphere cnetered on a point of your choice within
  range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's
  area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must
  make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't
  speak a deliverate lie while in the raidus. You know whether each
  creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

  An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid
  answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie.
  Such a creature can be evasive in answers as long as it remains
  within the boundaries of the truth.
