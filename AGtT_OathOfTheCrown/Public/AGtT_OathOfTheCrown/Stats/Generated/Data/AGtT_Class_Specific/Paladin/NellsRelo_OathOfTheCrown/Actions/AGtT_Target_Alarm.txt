  Alarm
  1st Level Alteration (Ritual)

  Casting Time: 1 minute
  Range: 30 feet
  Components: Somatic, Material
  Duration: 8 hours

  You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door,
  a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a
  20 foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you
  whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the
  warded area.

  When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that
  won't set off the alarm. You can also choose whether the
  alarm will be mental or audible.

  A mental alarm alerts you with a ping i your mind if you
  are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens
  you if you are sleeping.

  And audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10
  seconds within 60 feet.
