  In Defense of the Realm

  Starting at level 7, as long as you are conscious, you bolster the defences of all nearby
  friendly characters (or kinsmen?). The aura extends 3m from you in every direction.
  Non-enemy characters within the aura may add half your Charisma modifier to their AC.

  Enemies within the aura have their movement slowed by half your Charisma modifier.

  TODO: See if we can make it so that it only affects characters with the same homeland tag
  (I.E. Baldurian). Would be nice flavor that way.
